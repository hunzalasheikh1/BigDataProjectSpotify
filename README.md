# BigDataProjectSpotify




Phase 4: Reporting
Methodology Overview:
The project aimed to develop a streamlined alternative to Spotify, featuring a music recommendation system, playback, and streaming capabilities alongside real-time suggestions derived from user activity. The project was divided into three main phases:

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Pipeline: The Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset was utilized, comprising 106,574 tracks spanning 161 unevenly distributed genres. An Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline was developed using Python to load the dataset, execute feature extraction methods like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), spectral centroid, and zero-crossing rate, and store the extracted features in a MongoDB collection.

Music Recommendation Model: Apache Spark was employed to train a music recommendation model. The model utilized AnnoyIndex for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) search based on extracted audio features. Various feature extraction techniques were employed to convert audio files into numerical and vector formats for training the recommendation model.

Deployment: The trained recommendation model was deployed onto a web application using Flask. Apache Kafka was leveraged to dynamically generate music recommendations in real-time based on user activity, ensuring personalized suggestions for users. A user-friendly web interface was crafted to provide an interactive streaming experience.

Findings and Results:
Feature Extraction and Storage: The feature extraction process successfully transformed audio files into numerical features, including MFCC, spectral centroid, and zero-crossing rate. These features were stored in a MongoDB collection, ensuring scalability and accessibility.

Music Recommendation Model: An AnnoyIndex was utilized for efficient nearest neighbor search, enabling real-time recommendation generation based on user preferences. The model demonstrated promising results in recommending similar tracks to those liked by the user.

Deployment and Real-Time Recommendation: The web application was successfully deployed, providing users with an interactive music streaming experience. Apache Kafka facilitated real-time recommendation generation, ensuring that user preferences were dynamically considered.

Future Considerations:
Enhanced Model Training: Further exploration of deep learning methodologies could enhance the accuracy of the recommendation model. Experimenting with advanced neural network architectures tailored to music recommendation tasks could yield better results.

User Engagement Analytics: Incorporating user engagement analytics could provide valuable insights into user preferences and behavior. Analyzing factors such as listening patterns, skip rates, and user feedback could further personalize recommendations.

Integration of Additional Features: Integration of additional features such as playlist generation, mood-based recommendations, and social sharing functionalities could enhance the overall user experience and engagement.

Conclusion:
The developed alternative to Spotify successfully demonstrated the feasibility of building a personalized music streaming service with real-time recommendation capabilities. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and scalable data storage solutions, the project delivered a user-friendly platform for discovering and enjoying music. Further refinement and enhancement of the recommendation model and feature set could lead to a more immersive and engaging music streaming experience.
